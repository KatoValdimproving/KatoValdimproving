Magna acrylics on canvas

Color Field painter Friedel Dzubas was a pioneer of the stain painting technique alongside 20th century painters, Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, and Kenneth Noland. His earliest works evoked Paul Klee, but he soon moved towards working exclusively in colorful stain painting. He applied paint in a thin, texturally uniform manner creating fields of dense color and other areas where the color seemed almost translucent. For Dzubas, these paintings referenced natural phenomena, emotion, the painterly gesture, and the experience of color itself. Dzubas had a prolific art career that spanned nearly five decades.

These paintings are part of a seventeen-canvas installation. The others are displayed at Henry Ford Health System‚Äôs Royal Oak Medical Center

Simbiosis is a custom hanging sculpture created especially for the Brigitte Harris Cancer Pavilion. The sculpture features several imagined flying forms and seed pods inspired by the artist‚Äôs trip to Colombia. The artist utilized several different metalworking techniques to create each unique form and used interference acrylic paint with Micah flakes to produce the iridescent effect.

Juan creates sculptures that live and work among us, drawing from his experience as a science illustrator and fabricator working with metal, wood, and other materials. His work has been exhibited at Art Basel Miami, Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit (MOCAD), and in public and community spaces in Detroit, Los Angeles, and New York.  Juan‚Äôs artistic practice is informed by his commitment to community, with an emphasis on empowering and equipping Detroit youth for extraordinary futures.

Shared Blessings with Shared Visions is a custom artwork that honors the life and love story of Brigitte and Mort Harris. As a caring and compassionate wife and mother, Brigitte made major contributions to numerous arts and service organizations. She was also an avid tennis player and rose gardener. Through this work, the artist conveys her energy, and the love she had for her husband, family, and her community.
African symbols and patterns that symbolize faith, dreams, love, strength, perseverance, and hope are etched into the necktie and scarf shapes. The color forms symbolize the ups and downs we may experience yet through it all we keep finding the energy to press on, realizing with faith there are brighter days are ahead.
This sculpture is an extension of Cole‚Äôs Fragments of Frozen Sound Series, which makes use of various shapes and forms taken from the process of mapping. Underneath the tie and scarf shapes are map shapes of places where Brigitte lived including, Aachen, Germany, London, New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Stockholm, and Detroit. These shapes come together to combine with where her husband Mort was born, and where the two of them met and spent their lives together.
Kevin Cole is an Atlanta-based painter and mixed-media artist. Cole was born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and remains active in Atlanta, Georgia, and nationally. Cole was named Georgia State Artist of the Year in 1996 and has completed over 35 public art commissions, including the Coca-Cola Centennial Olympic Mural for the 1996 Olympic games and ‚ÄúSoul Ties That Matter,‚Äù a 55-foot-long installation created for Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in 2018. The artist‚Äôs work is included in more than 3,600 public, private, and corporate collections throughout the United States, including the National Museum of African American History and Culture at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.

Artist‚Äôs Statement:

‚ÄúInspired by positive and negative experiences that come with the foster care system, I was fortunate to find my voice, creative vision, and a connection with the outside world through the re-making of images.

The impermanence experienced has led me to create alternative perspectives based upon personal history.  Photo-based images, family memorabilia, and documents sourced from family members allow me to re-visit and revive previous impressions from past events.  Through a non-specific order of occurrence, these images begin to manifest into exaggerated accounts that are inconsistent from one event to another.  The use of traditional narrative and non-narrative aspects of storytelling is evident in the work, which allows me to challenge my family‚Äôs past, to re-imagine the future through fragmentation.

Repetition, dissemination, and the building of images in the work allows me to combine methods such as, painting, drawing, collage, and screen-printing, in a non-traditional manner on multi-sheets of paper, while creating singular pieces as well as large-scale site-specific installations.  These techniques enable me to work intuitively in multiple facets by distressing, excavating, and re-working the surface to ultimately reveal an unspecified narrative that become either isolated depictions, or re-configured images that transform the perception of space.‚Äù

Employing process as content, Detroit-based artist James Collins produces graphic line paintings that resemble warped photocopies and moir√© patterns. His multidimensional line-heavy works are created using a chance-based, custom process in which oil paint and water-based acrylic interact in a fluid state and repel each other. Relying on a precise chemical balance, Collins allows his materials to dictate their own outcomes. Though this technique, he can create entire paintings in one sitting. His goal, he has said, is not to create new imagery but to breathe new life into painting by giving art-making materials command over the resulting artwork. Collins‚Äôs earlier works involved layers of white and silver house paint wrapped in plastic wrap to add texture and allowed to flake and peel over time.

Artist‚Äôs Statement:

‚ÄúAfter the devastating death of my father and the near death of my mother in a home invasion shooting in a quiet suburban community; life as I knew it had changed forever. This unimaginable event gave me a harsh realization that life was short, and incidentally became the catalyst that inspired me. I reflected on my own life and how I had lived it up to now. Who would I be remembered as? A wife? A mother?

 Suddenly, I had clarity for my life's purpose, and I decided to make art a greater part of my life.

 Although I considered myself an artist since a young age and creativity had been a daily part of my life; I had not yet concentrated on developing my creative abilities.

With two school-age children, I enrolled as a full-time student at the College for Creative Studies, CCS.

Detroit inspired me. Initially I became fascinated with painting images of the city as it took me back to spending time with my father in places like Eastern Market, Downtown, Mexicantown, the Riverfront and more. I soon found my affection for the city was not shared by many of my fellow metro-Detroiters; not even the press.

A negative perception of Detroit was apparent and fueled my drive to validate the city's worth even more. Today I continue to paint positive images of this truly amazing city.‚Äù ‚Äì Darcel Deneau

//Carole Harris is a fiber artist who extends the boundaries of traditional quilting by exploring other forms of stitchery, irregular shapes, textures, materials, and objects. Her mother introduced her to needle arts at an early age, teaching her embroidery and crochet. It wasn‚Äôt until she received her BFA in art from Wayne State University in 1966 that she began to explore fibers as an art form.
//Carole is captivated by the interplay of hue and pattern, often drawing inspiration from the color, energy, movement, and rhythms of ethnographic rituals and textiles: as well as the music of and changing rhythms and history of the city of Detroit where she lives with her husband, Bill.
//Her process involves using commercially printed cottons, silks, hand-dyed and vintage fabrics, which she alters by overdyeing or painting. Carole often employs found objects, paper, rust dyeing, collage and even burning as techniques. These materials are cut up, overlaid, and repositioned creating a densely layered collage, with the top layer finished with hand-embroidery.
//‚ÄúI now draw inspiration from walls, aging structures and objects that reveal years of use. My intention is to celebrate the beauty in the frayed, the decaying and the repaired. I want to capture the patina of color softened by time, as well as feature the nicks, scratches, scars, and other marks left by nature or humans on constructed and natural surfaces. I want to interpret these changes and tell these stories of time, place and people in cloth, using creative stitching, layering and the mixing of colorful and textured fabrics.‚Äù  - Carole Harris

The Brigitte Harris Cancer Pavilion features reproductions of artistic masterpieces in the Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA) collection as part of the DIA‚Äôs Inside|Out program. Inside|Out is a popular component of the DIA‚Äôs community engagement efforts. Over the past 12 years, the museum has partnered with more than 100 communities and engaged tens of thousands of residents with art in places where they live, work and play.

The featured artworks and their locations were carefully selected with consideration to the physical and emotional journeys patients and families experience. For example, works near the elevator aim to give people something to consider while they wait and soothe anxiety in advance of or after their appointments. Works in the waiting areas feature serene but hopeful imagery that speaks to the future, while works displayed along the Nancy Vlasic Skywalk that connects to Henry Ford Hospital are colorful and dynamic to capture visitors‚Äô attention as they are in transit.

About the Detroit Institute of Arts:
The Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA), one of the premier art museums in the United States, is home to more than 60,000 works that comprise a multicultural survey of human creativity from ancient times through the 21st century. From the first Van Gogh painting to enter a U.S. museum (Self-Portrait, 1887), to Diego Rivera's world-renowned Detroit Industry murals (1932‚Äì33), the DIA‚Äôs collection is known for its quality, range, and depth.
